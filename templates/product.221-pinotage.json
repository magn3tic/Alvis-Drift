They arrived on South African shores after completing an undefeated tour of France and the British colonies, expecting to continue their winning streak. The rugby world was rocked when a young unknown, 19-year old Albertus Viljoen van der Merwe, “Alvi” to his friends, scored the first try in history against the All Blacks on African soil. <\/p><p>Our charismatic founder gripped the rugby world’s imagination by scoring this historic try, going on to be selected as the 221st player to play for the Springboks – South Africa’s national rugby team. With Alvi in their ranks, the Springboks turned the tide on “the invincibles”, going on to tour the UK and Europe undefeated. <\/p><p>Alvi’s farm in Worcester, South Africa has continued this winning legacy, remaining family owned and home to three generations of the Van Der Merwe family. Today, it is home to the Alvi’s Drift winery, producing internationally acclaimed, world-class wines of exceptional quality and value. <\/p><p>With our 221 range of Alvi’s Drift wines, we pay tribute to our patriarch, Oupa Alvi, and our winning Springbok rugby team.<\/p>","button-txt":"VIEW ALL OUR 221 RANGE WINES","button_link":"shopify:\/\/collections\/221-range","button_type":"alvisBtn"}},"164390119216bdfeb1":{"type":"Focus-Text-Image-Left","settings":{"background_colour":"#00000000","our-story-vid":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/chenin_blanc_3.jpg","image_size":"100%","video_url":"","Heading_size":"h2","Heading_color":"#c0ccbe","title":"ON THE VINES","video-sec-content-txt-1":"<p>With an ideal Mediterranean microclimate, an abundance of soil diversity and water from the life-giving Breede River, the Alvi’s Drift vineyards are ideally positioned for producing remarkable South African wines of unique character and complexity.<\/p><p>Our vineyards are sustainably fertilised with natural compost produced on our farm.
